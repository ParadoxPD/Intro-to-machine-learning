    "\n",
    "    <p>\n",
    "    Normalization is a scaling technique in which values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up \n",
    "    ranging between 0 and 1 or between -1 and 1. It is also known as Min-Max scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here, Xmax and Xmin are the maximum and the minimum values of the feature respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. When the value of X is the minimum value in the column, the numerator will be 0, andhence X’ is 0\n",
    "        2. On the other hand, when the value of X is the maximum value in the column, the numeratoris equal to the denominator and thus the value of X’ is 1\n",
    "        3. If the value of X is between the minimum and the maximum value, then the value of X’ isbetween 0 and 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Standardization is another scaling technique where the values are centered around the meanwith a unit standard deviation. This means that the mean of the attribute becomes zero and theresultant distribution has a unit standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, at the end of the day, the choice of using normalization or standardization will depend on your problem and the machine learning algorithm you are using. There is no hard and fast rule to tell you when to normalize or standardize your data. **You can always start by fitting your model to raw, normalized and standardized data and compare the performance for best results.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is a good practice to fit the scaler on the training data and then use it to transform the testing data. *This would avoid any data leakage during the model testing process. Also, the scaling of target values is generally not required.*\n",
